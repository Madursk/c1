<b>BASES AND LIMITS OF DEEP LEARNING</b>
<p>
This course presents an introduction of the bases and limits of Deep
Learning. We will explain some basics questions such as, What is
Deep Learning?, Why is deep learning so powerful and what can it be
used for?. However, we present as well as some advanced topics such
as some Deep Learning limitations and open problems. Additionally,
we will cover the necessary topics to learn how to apply or adapt
these ideas into new solutions in the hands-on sessions. We will
focus in Convolutional Neural Networks and see how them work
for yourself.
